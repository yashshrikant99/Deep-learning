# Detecting the location of infarct in the brain
We have built a CNN(convolutional nueral network)model using tensorflow to predict the location of acute infarct in the brain given the MRI scans of patients
## Getting started ##
### Prerequisites ###
Any major browser which supports Google Colaboratory.
Dataset used: 50 MRI scans of patients brain with location of acute infarct
## Running the tests ##
* upon running our model we got a training accuracy of *88%*
- When tested the model on new unseen data we got an accuracy of *27.8 %*
> The testing accuracy values indicated above are low due to the small size of the dataset which was used
## Built with ##
